"""api.py — the local server. Stdlib only; no third-party dependencies.

Serves the existing static front end AND the inspection API from the SAME
origin, which removes the entire CORS surface by construction: with no
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header anywhere, a cross-origin page cannot read a
single response.

Security decisions, in the order they are enforced:

  1. HOST ALLOWLIST, before routing or any I/O. `127.0.0.1` is not a security
     boundary: with DNS rebinding a page on evil.example keeps its own origin
     while resolving to loopback, so the same-origin policy lets it read every
     response. The browser sends `Host: evil.example:PORT`, so an exact-match
     allowlist on Host is what actually stops it. Safari does not implement
     Private Network Access, so nothing else will.
  2. A RANDOM HIGH PORT chosen at startup, so an attacker page must guess it.
  3. NO PATH PARAMETERS THAT REACH THE FILESYSTEM. Ids are integers; static
     paths are matched against an explicit allowlist and re-checked after
     realpath.
  4. NO RAW SAMPLE BYTES. Previews are server-rendered hexdumps. Returning a
     member's bytes on this origin would let an archive containing `x.html`
     execute script inside the application origin.
